### **Context**

The Smart lab Check project consists of a system that allows the detection and identification of equipment, materials and components present and absent from any laboratory.
To implement this equipment tracking system, two systems with different functionalities were developed. These systems are called Check Box and Check IN/OUT.

The Check Box performs the verification and management of laboratory materials, while the Check IN/OUT system intends to detect the exit or 
entry into the laboratory of electronic equipment of higher cost/importance (oscilloscope, power supplies or signal) and also components and boxes.

The present project focused on the realization of two methodologies: one checks if the laboratory boxes 
contain the tools, if not, it indicates which ones are missing. The second is the verification and signaling 
of electronic equipment leaving the laboratory. 

In the end, everything can be seen through the online platform Node-RED and be stored in the database
